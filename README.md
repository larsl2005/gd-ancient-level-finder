# gd-ancient-level-finder
this is my level finder thingy for geoemtry dash.
HOW TO USE:
just enter a minimum and maximum id and press start, it will search for levels with an id between the minimum and maximum and paste them into the textbox.


TODO:
make it support 1.9 private servers (DONE, COMING IN NEW UPDATE)
make it so you can hide the debug output.
make the code and comments not a pain in the ass todo.

ADITIONAL NOTES:
its open source, so you can use the code and see my horrible code.
