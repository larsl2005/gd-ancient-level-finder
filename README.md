# gd-ancient-level-finder
this is my level finder thingy for geoemtry dash.
HOW TO USE:
just enter a minimum and maximum id and press start, it will search for levels with an id between the minimum and maximum and paste them into the textbox.


TODO:
make it so you dont have to edit the program to support private servers.
make it so you can hide the debug output.
make the minimum id be able to be less than 128 for when i add private server support (that is the most early level on the main server).
make the clear button also clear the console.
make the code and comments not a pain in the ass todo.

ADITIONAL NOTES:
its open source, so you can use the code and see my horrible code.
